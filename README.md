# Overview
C++ library for linear algebra vector. The code and interfaces are inspired by Udacity's "Linear Algebra Refresher" course. 

# Why C++?
I used C++ because I wanted to expand my knowledge of the language

# Current status
- [X] Initial implementation
- [ ] Add Bazel build file
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Expand the interface by finishing a linear algebra unit
